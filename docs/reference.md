In the reference section, you can find reference documentation for IFC model schemas and schema-languages aswel as our glossary and design docs.


## Schemas

Below you will find links to the schema documentation. The documentation is written according to specification in the EXPRESS data modeling language.

Documentation reference include EXPRESS and XML reference schema-languages for schema as standard. This is in accordance with ISO specification but other schema-languages can be seen in the Extension references section below.

* [IFC 2](/docs/reference/schemas/ifc2.md/overview/) - Schemata for IFC 2. (latest)
* [IFC2x3](/docs/reference/schemas/ifc2x3.md/overview/) - Schemata for IFC2x3 (latest)
* [IFC4](/docs/reference/schemas/ifc4.md/overview/) - Schemata for IFC4 (latest)
* [IFC5](/docs/reference/schemas/ifc5.md/overview/) - Schemata for IFC5 (WIP)
* [IFC HISTORY](/docs/reference/schemas/ifc-history/overview/) - A complete list of IFC schemata issued

## Extension References

The IFC schema have various representations and you can find them below.

* [IFC EXPRESS](/docs/reference/schema-languages/ifc-express/express-overview/) - IFC schema in EXPRESS data modeling language
* [IFC EXPRESS-G](/docs/reference/schema-languages/ifc-express/express-g-overview/) - IFC schema in EXPRESS-G(GRAPHICAL) data modeling language.
* [IFC OWL](/docs/reference/schema-languages/ifc-owl/owl-overview/) - IFC schema to Web Ontology Language.
* [IFC XSD](/docs/reference/schema-languages/ifc-xsd/xsd-overview/) - IFC schema in XSD data modeling language

## Subsets

Subsets can be used to create a specific schema that may be suitable for a data exhange edge use-case.

* [IFC MVD](/docs/reference/subset/ifc-mvd/mvd-overview/) - IFC Model-View-Definition demonstrates a subset of the IFC schema

## Data Formats

Single individual models representing buildigns can be represented in the following formats.

* [IFC RDF](/docs/reference/data-formats/ifc-rdf/rdf-overview/) - A building representation with semantic detail.
* [IFC SPF](/docs/reference/data-formats/ifc-spf/spf-overview/) - This is the physical file-format, also known as a STEP file.
* [IFC XML](/docs/reference/data-formats/ifc-xml/xml-overview/) - A format designed to be read by machine and human.
