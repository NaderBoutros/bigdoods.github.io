This section of the IFC documentation contains tutorials.
A tutorial shows how to accomplish a goal that is larger than a single
[task](/docs/tasks/). Typically a tutorial has several sections,
each of which has a sequence of steps.

#### IFC Basics

* [IFC Basics](/docs/tutorials/) is an in-depth interactive tutorial that helps you understand the IFC system and try out some basic IFC features.


If you would like to write a tutorial, see
[Using Page Templates](/docs/contribute/page-templates/)
for information about the tutorial page type and the tutorial template.
