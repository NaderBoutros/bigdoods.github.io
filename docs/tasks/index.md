title: Tasks

This section of the IFC documentation contains pages that
show how to do individual tasks. A task page shows how to do a
single thing, typically by giving a short sequence of steps.

#### Configuring Pods and Containers

* [Defining Environment Variables for a Container](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/define-environment-variable-container/)
* [Defining a Command and Arguments for a Container](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/define-command-argument-container/)

### What's next

If you would like to write a task page, see
[Creating a Documentation Pull Request](/docs/contribute/create-pull-request/).
