## Deprecating a flag or CLI

The IFC system is comprised of several different layers cooperating.
Sometimes, an IFC release might remove ....
A flag is explicitly prefixed or documented as "alpha" or "beta", it is considered GA.


## Deprecating a feature or behavior

Occasionally a Kubernetes release needs to deprecate some feature or behavior of the system that is not controlled by these layers...


## Exceptions

No policy can cover every possible situation.  This policy is a living
document, and will evolve over time.  In practice, there will be situations
that do not fit neatly into this policy, or for which this policy becomes a
serious impediment.  Such situations should be discussed with SIGs and project
leaders to find the best solutions for those specific cases, always bearing in
mind that IFC project is committed to being a stable system that, as much as
possible, never breaks users. Exceptions will always be announced in all
relevant release notes.
